## ToddlerTimer

ToddlerTimer is an Android app designed to help highly focused young children transition from one activity to another in a low stress manner, by using fun colors to count down the time until the next activity, and ending with a fun animal sound of the children's choosing.

This project is still in progress, check back later for more.
